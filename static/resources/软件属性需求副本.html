<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>Design and implementation of 6.1 correct software system, and should be carried out in accordance with the software requirements specification. The final product should be fully in line with the requirements of the software.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6.2 reliability web products need to overcome a major problem is high concurrency, product design, we should try to consider in high server load, our website should not therefore collapse, should not lose the user reputation. And since the product itself involves two points and mall system, and other users of the relevant information and privacy. Safe and reliable is one of the main goals that we pursue.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6.3 efficiency interactive game is a function of the product. I need to ensure that the product is high load in the server, and can also meet the high efficiency of user interaction. We should try to avoid the occurrence of long waiting for the user, but also should try to avoid the delay of the game, reduce user experience. In addition, there is still a point, it should take full account of the user's terminal configuration should not become an obstacle to reduce the efficiency of the product factor. So we should try our best to minimize the minimum configuration of hardware..</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6.4 easy to use product itself is facing the public leisure interactive game entertainment website. The main is a leisure entertainment, users use our products should be relaxed. This leads to the product should be able to quickly get started, easy to use. Otherwise, will greatly increase the user's burden of use. So, our product should be user-friendly ".</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6.5 maintenance maintenance products is the priority among priorities in the life cycle of software. Our products are Web products, the growing user will inevitably lead to the continuous discovery of defects, only with high maintainability, can quickly find the cause and repair the problem. So as to achieve the purpose of reducing maintenance costs. If the maintenance of the product is very poor, on the one hand, will lead to the problem of investigation and repair difficult to increase; on the other hand, is also extremely important aspect, will lead to the loss of users!</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>6.6 portability because the product is Web application, complete run in Web browser. And the browser is almost all the basic software platform. So it can be said that the product itself has a good cross platform. Therefore, the portability of the product depends on compatibility with different browsers.</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><b>As an Internet product 6.7 interconnection, user data and operation data is very valuable, should give full consideration to our software system data interface, to meet future may appear in the data migration problem.</b></span></p>
